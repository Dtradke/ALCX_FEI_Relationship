This repository works towards question 23 for Alchemix bounties on the webpage https://www.notion.so/Analytics-Bounties-for-Alchemix-ffd6c25bdef3486c9b8dfa9476ac6a39. With this question, we are interested in understanding the differences in how users work with their ALCX and FEI/TRIBE for the subset of users who attended the FEI Genesis Event. In our analysis, we use Flipside Crypto data with the Pandas and Numpy Python libraries.

Our solution is located in a jupyter notebook.

We have included multiple ways to view the report:

Question_23_notebook.ipynb --> This is a jupyter notebook. The code can be actually run in here by execting "jupyter notebook Question_23_notebook.ipynb" in terminal from this directory.

Question_23_notebook.pdf --> This is an exported PDF document of the write-up and code included in the jupyter notebook. This also includes the graphs that the code generates.
